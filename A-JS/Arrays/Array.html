    Arrays
    Casey Reas and Ben Fry . The term array refers to a structured grouping or an imposing number:
    “The dinner buffet offers an array of choices,”“The city of Boston faces an array of problems.”
    In computer programming, an array is a set of data elements stored under the same name. Arrays can be created to hold any type of data, and each element can be individually assigned and read.There can be arrays of numbers, characters, sentences, boolean values, and so on. 
    Arrays might store vertex data for complex shapes, recent keystrokes from the keyboard, or data read from a file. 
    For instance, an array can store five integers (1919, 1940, 1975, 1976, 1990), 
    the years to date that the Cincinnati Reds won the World Series, rather than defining five separate variables. 
    Array elements are numbered starting with zero, which may seem confusing at first but is an important detail for many programming languages.
    The first element is at position [0], the second is at [1], and so on. The position of each element is determined by its offset from the start of the array.
    The first element is at position [0] because it has no offset; the second element is at position [1] because it is offset one place from the beginning.
    The last position in the array is calculated by subtracting 1 from the array length.
